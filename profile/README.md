## Hello there ðŸ‘‹

Im going to be using this to store different repos where I can simply return later to refer back to things that I have learned and to collect the things that im building since the feed on the profile on github looks awful after just a couple of repos. 

Keep in mind that I jsut got this idea recently so it might looks quite empty for a while. The readme files will be finished as I find time. 

## Currently working on:

### Private:

I am currently working on a simple website where I can share images of stickers that I have taken around Stockholm on walks. I am using react for the frontend and have built a simple backend api which will connect to an azure blob and database.

### At school:

We are currently doing a devops course where we are going to be learning to use Azure Devops for pipelines and gitflow. We have been given a car simulator where we are going to be finding the problems and fixing them and creating tests while properly using branches and CI/CD.

## Repos:

### Yaml code writeup for the DevOps course:

### Documentation and API key:

### React frontend base given to us by the teacher:

### Password hasher:

### JavaScript and C# exercises:

These are random exercises in both Javascript and C# which I got from chatgpt to train more basic stuff which we didn't bother with after the first couple of classes. I honestly think we only used a for loop less than 10 times in the first course and then never since. I need to add more to these and practice even more often.

## Ventixe:

This is from a assignment from school at Nackademin in Stockholm. It is a bunch of different apis, some of which were connected to the react frontend in the bottom of this section.

https://github.com/SkyInkLearning/Ventixe_Rules_API

https://github.com/SkyInkLearning/Ventixe_Terms_API

These two are to be used together. I never got so far as to implement their usage in the frontend.

https://github.com/SkyInkLearning/Ventixe_Map_API

https://github.com/SkyInkLearning/Ventixe_Mapimage_Handler_API

These two are also to be used together. I never got so far as to implement their usage in the frontend due to circumstances outside of my choosing.

### The frontend of the project:

I ended up being the only one to add any documentation to the repository.
