## Enlo there ðŸ‘‹

Im going to be using this to store different repos where I can simply return later to refer back to things that I have learned and to collect things that im building.

## Currently working on:

### Private:

I am currently working on the first version of a website where I can share images of stickers that I have taken around Stockholm on walks. I am using react for the frontend and have built a simple backend api which will connect to an azure blob and database.

### At school:

We are currently doing a devops course where we are going to be learning to use Azure Devops for pipelines and gitflow. We have been given a car simulator where we are going to be finding the problems and fixing them and creating tests while properly using branches and CI/CD.

These two are to be used together. I never got so far as to implement their usage in the frontend.

https://github.com/SkyInkLearning/Ventixe_Map_API

https://github.com/SkyInkLearning/Ventixe_Mapimage_Handler_API

These two are also to be used together. I never got so far as to implement their usage in the frontend due to circumstances outside of my choosing.
